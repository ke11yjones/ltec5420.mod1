	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I’m Kelly Jones and I am a native Texan, born and raised in Dallas and currently living in Lancaster with my family. I’m a graduate student in the Learning Technologies program but earned my undergraduate degree in Applied Technology and Performance Improvement here at UNT in December 2020. I’m a fulltime wife and mom, and a parttime student.</p>
	
	<p>When not working on school assignments, I enjoy spending time with my family, gardening, listening to music and audio books, and watching legal, medical, or police dramas on television.</p>

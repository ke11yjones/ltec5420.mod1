	<h1>Goals</h1>
	<p>When I think about my goals I've become a lot more flexible because I realize that life has a funny way of pulling the rug out from under you. So my goals are more like a moving target versus a something that I absolutely must attain without fail. With that being said, my overall LIFE goals are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Raise a happy, healthy, well-adjusted kid who is thoughtful, loving, kind, compassionate, and confident.</li>
		<li>Provide emotional support to my husband and family.</li>
		<li>Earn my graduate and hopefully doctoral degrees.</li>
		<li>Find a position at a college or university that specifically supports the academic needs of "non-traditonal" or more specifically, older college students.</li>
		<li>(Insert pagaent voice) Obtain world peace (lol).</li>
	</ol>

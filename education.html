	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p>I am a PROUD graduate of Skyline High School in Dallas, Texas. While in high school I studied television production and a little bit of photograpy. After graduating I enrolled in what is now known as Dallas College, at the time it was merely called the DCCCD which stood for Dallas County Community College District. I attended classes at the Mountain View campus accumulating undergraduate credits that I would later transfer to other schools.</p>
	
	<p>Due to a job transfer I moved to Atlanta, GA. While living in a suburb of the city I enrolled in Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta, GA. I enrolled in the Techical and Professional Communications (TCOM) program because I felt like it would help me improve my skills as a trainer. </p>
	
	<p>Fast-forward to 2007 and my family and I move back to Texas and in 2008 I enroll in online courses at Eastfield Community College as well as at the University of North Texas, this was my first attempt at online learning. The courses at UNT went well. I completed everything for the Applied Technology and Performance Improvement degree except for the university's core math requirement. I taken college algebra a couple of times unsuccessfully and at that point I couldn't proceed any further without passing the class. So I took a 10yr break from school and focused on my family. </p>
	
	<p>Finally in 2020, after a 10yr hiatus I enrolled in a dual credit math class that combined developmental math with college algebra and in December 2020 I finally earned my college degree. Immediately upon earning my undergraduate degree I applied for and was accepted into the Learning Technologies graduate program at UNT. I'm on track to graduate from the program in the Spring of 2023 and upon graduation I hope to secure a spot in the doctoral program at Northwestern State Unversity in Louisiana focusing on adult learning and development.</p>
